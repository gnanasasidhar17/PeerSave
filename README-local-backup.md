# PeerSave â€“ A Peer-Driven Saving Platform  

A social saving app where friends, families, or small groups set common financial goals, contribute together, and stay motivated through accountability and gamification.  

---

## Idea / Overview  
PeerSave is a web app that helps people **save collectively**. Users can form saving groups for specific goals (like trips, gadgets, or emergency funds), track contributions, and encourage each other to stay consistent. Group accountability and gamified progress make saving more fun and achievable.
